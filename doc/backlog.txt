Pending tasks:

- Add validators to the required elements
- Update UML model

- Access control: we implemented a very basic support. It is missing a logout 
option, timeout and the definition of different types of users (admin, plain). Only
admin users should be able to create new users or edit their data. Plain
users would be allowed only to change his data. At that moment, all 
functionalities are open to all users. Check restful_authentication and 
AuthLogic as alternatives to implement a real authentication support.
