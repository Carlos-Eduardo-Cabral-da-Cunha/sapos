Pending tasks:

- Date format
- Adding record_select to the expected fields
- Fix layout color
- Fix the field order in create/update forms
- Add validators to the required elements
- Update UML model
- Allow users to logout
- Timeout user section after a certain period of inactivity
- delete cascade

- Access control: we implemented a very basic support. It is missing a logout 
option and the definition of different types of users (admin, plain). Only
admin users should be able to create new users or edit their data. Plain
users would be allowed only to change his data. At that moment, all 
functionalities are open to all users.
