#About

The SAPOS Project has the purpose to ease the information management concerning the coordination of the Graduate in Computer Science course from the Fluminense Federal University.

<br>

Currently the system is hosted in the Software Engineering Lab, thanks to the colaboration of the teacher
 **Leonardo Gresta Paulino Murta**.

<br>

The project was the result of the final paper of the students **Rodrigo Dias** and **Tiago Amaro**, both from the Computer Science Bachelor course of the Fluminense Federal University. The paper was led by the teachers **Leonardo Murta** and **Vanessa Braganholo**.
